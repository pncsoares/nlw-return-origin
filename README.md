# RocketSeat | Next Level Week Return | Origin team

[Next Level Week](https://nextlevelweek.com) is a yearly event created by [RocketSeat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/sobre).

The goal of this event is to teach and share knowledge about frontend, backend and mobile applications.

The tech stack that they use the most is React, React Native and Node.

This year, we created a responsive website to DoctorCare.
